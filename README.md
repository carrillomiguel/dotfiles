# Personal Linux Configuration Files

*A screenshot of my Linux desktop using my config files.*

## Description

Here are some of my configuration files for my custom Linux desktop. Feel free to use, change or copy these however you like. Over the years I've experimented with different desktop environments, window managers, styles, and themes and I've finally settled on this configuration.

## Requirements

This repository includes configuration files for the following:

[alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
[bash](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git)
[i3](https://github.com/i3/i3)
[neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
[xorg](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver)
[zsh](https://sourceforge.net/p/zsh/code/ci/master/tree/)

I also use the GTK Theme [Materia Blackout](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1381066) and the [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) icons 

## Usage

To use these, make sure you have the required software installed for each respective config file and move them into your home directory. Be sure to login as a different user if you want to experiment with them first. Some configuration files have lines that are specific to my hardware and software so be sure to refer to the respective user manuals for any issues.
